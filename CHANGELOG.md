# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-01

Initial release.

- `#[dispatchable]` on a trait and `#[dispatch(Trait)]` on an enum, across
  crates, with no state kept between expansions.
- Associated types from the first variant, checked against every other
  variant, or fixed with `Name = Type` and unified through `Into`.
- Associated consts from the first variant.
- `Self`, `&Self` and `&mut Self` arguments matched on the same variant,
  with the fallback declared by `mismatch`.
- `Self`, `Option<Self>` and `Result<Self, E>` returns wrapped back into
  the variant.
- Generic traits at a concrete instantiation, including lifetimes, const
  generics and `W::Assoc` projections; generic enums.
- `async fn`, `unsafe fn`, generic methods, `#[cfg]` on methods and
  variants, `#[inline]` on every generated method.
- `From<Payload>` for every payload type held by one variant, `from = false`
  to opt out.
- `#[dispatch(deref)]` on a variant for `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `&T`
  and `&mut T` payloads.
